Same as Jekyll and other static page generator framework, rather than taking data from database Gatsby JS is compiling content from template code and your text in markdown file into ready static page for each of your post. \\n2. **React JS ([https://reactjs.org/](https://reactjs.org/))**: React JS is user interface library based on JavaScript programming language. Gatsby JS is built on top of React JS framework which allow interactivity on navigating through page.\\n3. **GitHub Pages ([https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com))**: GitHub Pages is service that allow you to host a website (especially Jekyll's website) into your repository. Just push your Jekyll's site to your page repository (yourusername.github.io) and your website will be hosted. \\n4. **Bootstrap ([https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com))**: Bootstrap is awesome open-source front-end framework. With Bootstrap, you'll get some good design of layout, typograph, button and some other component rather than designing from the stratch.\\n5. **Font Awesome ([https://fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com))**: Font Awesome is a toolkit font with more option of icon and style over 15.000+.\\n6. **Google Fonts ([https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/))**: Just a repository from Google that hosted so many popular fonts. You also can get some good combinaton of using fonts here.\\n\\n### Credits\\n\\n1. **gatsby-starter-prologue ([https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-prologue/](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/anubhavsrivastava/gatsby-starter-prologue/))**: When I first trying to migrate this site from Jekyll to Gatsby JS, I don't have any experience in using Gatsby JS, React JS or Node JS based project. So, I grab this template to preparing first building blocks of this website.\\n2. **Meme_api ([https://github.com/R3l3ntl3ss/Meme_Api](https://github.com/R3l3ntl3ss/Meme_Api))** Random meme generator API that I used for my 404 page :D\\n3.
