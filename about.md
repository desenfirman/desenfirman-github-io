## Credit & tools I use to make this website. 

##### Web technology & tools I use
- **Jekyll ([https://jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com))**: Jekyll is static page generator. Rather than taking data from database, Jekyll is compiling content from some template, layout and some text into ready static page. 
- **GitHub Pages ([https://pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com))**: GitHub Pages is service that allow you to host a website (especially Jekyll's website) into your repository. Just push your Jekyll's site to your page repository (yourusername.github.io) and your website will be hosted. 
- **Bootstrap ([https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com))**: Bootstrap is awesome open-source front-end framework. With Bootstrap, you'll get some good design of layout, typograph, button and some other component rather than designing from the stratch.
- **Font Awesome ([https://fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com))**: Font Awesome is a toolkit font with more option of icon and style over 15.000+. 
- **Google Fonts ([https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/))**: Just a repository form Google that hosted so many popular fonts. You also can get some good combinaton of using fonts here.

##### Credits 
- **jekyll-now ([https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now))**: jekyll-now is helping me especially for preparing first building blocks of this website. With jekyll-now, you'll get some ready basic functional of your blog, rather than preparing the setup when using 'raw Jekyll'. Just forked it, change the name of repository and you'll ready for writing your blog.
